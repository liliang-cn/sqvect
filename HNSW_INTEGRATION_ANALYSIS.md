# HNSW Integration Analysis for sqvect

## Executive Summary

Adding HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) optimization to the sqvect library is highly feasible and would provide significant performance improvements for vector search operations. This document outlines the current state, integration opportunities, and implementation approaches.

## Current State Analysis

The sqvect library currently uses brute-force linear search in `store.go:218-238`, checking every vector for similarity calculation. Key characteristics:

- **Search Method**: Linear scan through all stored vectors
- **Performance**: ~60 searches/sec for 1K vectors (from benchmark results)
- **Scalability**: Performance degrades linearly with dataset size
- **Storage**: SQLite-based with BLOB vector storage
- **Similarity Functions**: Cosine, dot product, Euclidean distance

### Current Search Flow
1. `fetchCandidates()` - Retrieves all vectors from SQLite
2. `scoreCandidates()` - Calculates similarity scores for each vector
3. Sort and return top-k results

## HNSW Integration Opportunities

### 1. Primary Integration Point: Search Method
**Location**: `store.go:218` - `Search()` method
- Replace linear `fetchCandidates` + `scoreCandidates` with HNSW graph traversal
- Maintain existing filtering logic for metadata/doc_id constraints
- Preserve current API interface for backward compatibility

### 2. Index Management Points
**Upsert Operations**: `store.go:109` (single), `store.go:147` (batch)
- Add vectors to HNSW index during insertion
- Maintain index consistency with SQLite storage
- Handle index updates for existing vector modifications

### 3. Persistence Strategy
- Store HNSW index structure alongside SQLite database
- Options: Binary serialization, reconstruction on startup, or hybrid approach

## Available Go HNSW Libraries

### Primary Option: github.com/fogfish/hnsw
**Features:**
- Generic implementation supporting custom vector types
- Configurable parameters (M, efConstruction, efSearch)
- Batch insertion with parallel processing
- Custom distance metric support
- Command-line optimization tools

**API Example:**
```go
index := hnsw.New(vector.SurfaceVF32(surface.Cosine()),
    hnsw.WithEfConstruction(200),
    hnsw.WithM(16)
)
index.Insert(vector.VF32{Key: 1, Vec: []float32{0.1, 0.2, 0.128}})
neighbors := index.Search(query, 10, 100)
```

## Recommended Implementation Approaches

### Option 1: Hybrid Architecture (Recommended)

**Architecture:**
```go
type SQLiteStore struct {
    db           *sql.DB
    config       Config
    mu           sync.RWMutex
    closed       bool
    similarityFn SimilarityFunc
    hnswIndex    *hnsw.Index // Add HNSW index
    hnswEnabled  bool        // Configuration flag
}
```

**Benefits:**
- SQLite handles metadata, content, and persistence
- HNSW provides fast vector search capabilities
- Maintains complete API compatibility
- Allows gradual migration and A/B testing
- Fallback to linear search if needed

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Dual storage: SQLite for data persistence, HNSW for search optimization
- Search operation uses HNSW to find candidate IDs, then fetches full records from SQLite
- Maintains existing filtering and metadata capabilities

### Option 2: Configuration-Based Approach

**Features:**
- Add `EnableHNSW` flag to Config struct
- Runtime switching between HNSW and linear search
- Allows performance comparison and gradual rollout

**Configuration Extension:**
```go
type Config struct {
    Path         string
    VectorDim    int
    MaxConns     int
    SimilarityFn SimilarityFunc
    EnableHNSW   bool           // New flag
    HNSWConfig   HNSWParameters // HNSW-specific settings
}

type HNSWParameters struct {
    M              int     // Max connections per node
    EfConstruction int     // Candidates during construction
    EfSearch       int     // Candidates during search
}
```

## Expected Performance Impact

### Search Performance
- **Current**: ~60 searches/sec (768d vectors, 10K dataset)
- **With HNSW**: ~60,000+ searches/sec (estimated 1000x improvement)
- **Accuracy**: 95-99% recall with proper parameter tuning

### Memory Usage
- **Increase**: ~2-3x due to HNSW graph structure
- **Index Size**: Approximately 4-8 bytes per vector per connection (M parameter)

### Insert Performance
- **Impact**: 10-30% slower due to graph maintenance
- **Batch Operations**: Better amortized performance with HNSW batch insertion

### Storage Requirements
- **SQLite Database**: Unchanged (metadata, content, vectors)
- **HNSW Index**: Additional memory/disk for graph structure
- **Total Overhead**: ~50-100% increase depending on parameters

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Add `github.com/fogfish/hnsw` dependency to go.mod
2. Extend Config struct with HNSW parameters
3. Add HNSW index field to SQLiteStore struct
4. Implement index initialization in `Init()` method

### Phase 2: Core Integration
1. Modify `Search()` method to use HNSW when enabled
2. Update `Upsert()` and `UpsertBatch()` methods to maintain HNSW index
3. Add index persistence/reconstruction logic
4. Implement fallback mechanisms for error cases

### Phase 3: Optimization
1. Add index persistence to disk for faster startup
2. Implement incremental index updates
3. Add performance monitoring and tuning capabilities
4. Optimize memory usage and garbage collection

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. Add index statistics and health monitoring
2. Implement index rebuilding and maintenance operations
3. Add configuration validation and parameter tuning utilities
4. Performance benchmarking and comparison tools

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- **API Compatibility**: No breaking changes to existing interface
- **Fallback Strategy**: Can disable HNSW if issues occur
- **Incremental Adoption**: Optional feature with gradual rollout

### Medium Risk
- **Memory Usage**: Increased memory footprint may impact some deployments
- **Complexity**: Additional code paths and error handling required
- **Dependency**: New external dependency (fogfish/hnsw)

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive testing with various dataset sizes
- Memory usage monitoring and optimization
- Graceful degradation to linear search on errors
- Extensive documentation and configuration guidance

## Conclusion

HNSW integration is highly recommended for the sqvect library. The hybrid architecture approach provides the best balance of performance improvement, backward compatibility, and risk mitigation. Expected benefits include:

- **1000x search performance improvement** for large datasets
- **Maintained API compatibility** for existing users
- **Scalability** to millions of vectors
- **Production readiness** for high-performance RAG applications

The implementation should be phased to allow testing and validation at each step, ensuring a smooth transition from the current linear search approach to the optimized HNSW-based solution.
