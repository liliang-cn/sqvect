// to its workers and each of them, and the queen, recalls on the same text
// within a few milliseconds. Each recall is a full search — an embedding, a
// vector scan, up to four full-text queries — and on a two-core node sixteen
// of them at once queue for the CPU for seconds. The answer to a question
// asked twice in the same instant is the same answer, so it is computed once
// and handed to everyone who asked; each of them is still counted as a recall.

// sharedSearchTimeout bounds a search run on behalf of several callers, which
// does not end when the one that started it gives up.
